# Improve Codebase Architecture

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities** — refactors
that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and
AI-navigability.

## Glossary

Use these terms exactly in every suggestion. Consistent language is critical.

- **Module** — anything with an interface and an implementation (function, class,
  package, slice).
- **Interface** — everything a caller must know to use the module: types,
  invariants, error modes, ordering, config. Not just the type signature.
- **Implementation** — the code inside.
- **Depth** — leverage at the interface: a lot of behavior behind a small
  interface. **Deep** = high leverage. **Shallow** = interface nearly as complex
  as the implementation.
- **Seam** — where an interface lives; a place behavior can be altered without
  editing in place.
- **Adapter** — a concrete thing satisfying an interface at a seam.
- **Leverage** — what callers get from depth.
- **Locality** — what maintainers get from depth: change, bugs, knowledge
  concentrated in one place.

## Key Principles

- **Deletion test**: imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, it was
  a pass-through. If complexity reappears across N callers, it was earning its
  keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.**
- **One adapter = hypothetical seam. Two adapters = real seam.**

This skill is _informed_ by the project's domain model. The domain language gives
names to good seams; ADRs record decisions the skill should not re-litigate.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Read the project's domain glossary (`CONTEXT.md`) and any ADRs in the area you're
touching first.

Walk the codebase organically and note where you experience friction:

- Where does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small
  modules?
- Where are modules **shallow** — interface nearly as complex as the
  implementation?
- Where have pure functions been extracted just for testability, but the real
  bugs hide in how they're called (no **locality**)?
- Where do tightly-coupled modules leak across their seams?
- Which parts of the codebase are untested, or hard to test through their
  current interface?

Apply the **deletion test** to anything you suspect is shallow: would deleting it
concentrate complexity, or just move it? A "yes, concentrates" is the signal you
want.

### 2. Present Candidates as an HTML Report

Write a self-contained HTML file to the OS temp directory so nothing lands in the
repo. Resolve the temp dir from `$TMPDIR`, falling back to `/tmp` (or `%TEMP%`
on Windows), and write to `<tmpdir>/architecture-review-<timestamp>.html` so
each run gets a fresh file. Open it for the user — `xdg-open <path>` on Linux,
`open <path>` on macOS, `start <path>` on Windows — and tell them the absolute
path.

The report uses **Tailwind via CDN** for layout and styling, and **Mermaid via
CDN** for diagrams where a graph/flow/sequence reliably communicates the
structure. Mix Mermaid with hand-crafted CSS/SVG visuals — use Mermaid when
relationships are graph-shaped (call graphs, dependencies, sequences), and
hand-built divs/SVG when you want something more editorial (mass diagrams,
cross-sections, collapse animations).

For each candidate, provide:

- **Files** — which files/modules are involved
- **Problem** — why the current architecture is causing friction
- **Solution** — plain English description of what would change
- **Benefits** — explained in terms of locality and leverage, and how tests would
  improve
- **Before / After diagram** — side-by-side, custom-drawn, illustrating the
  shallowness and the deepening
- **Recommendation strength** — one of `Strong`, `Worth exploring`,
  `Speculative`, rendered as a badge

End the report with a **Top recommendation** section: which candidate you'd tackle
first and why.

**Use CONTEXT.md vocabulary** for the domain ("the Order intake module" not "the
FooBarHandler").

**ADR conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an existing ADR, only surface it
when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting the ADR. Mark it clearly
(e.g. a warning callout: _"contradicts ADR-0007 — but worth reopening
because…"_). Don't list every theoretical refactor an ADR forbids.

Do NOT propose interfaces yet. After the file is written, ask the user: "Which of
these would you like to explore?"

### 3. Grilling Loop

Once the user picks a candidate, drop into a grilling conversation. Walk the
design tree with them — constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened
module, what sits behind the seam, what tests survive.

Side effects happen inline as decisions crystallize:

- **Naming a deepened module after a concept not in CONTEXT.md?** Add the term
  to `CONTEXT.md` — same discipline as `/grill-with-docs`. Create the file
  lazily if it doesn't exist.
- **Sharpening a fuzzy term during the conversation?** Update `CONTEXT.md` right
  there.
- **User rejects the candidate with a load-bearing reason?** Offer an ADR, framed
  as: _"Want me to record this as an ADR so future architecture reviews don't
  re-suggest it?"_ Only offer when the reason would actually be needed by a
  future explorer to avoid re-suggesting the same thing — skip ephemeral
  reasons ("not worth it right now") and self-evident ones.
- **Want to explore alternative interfaces for the deepened module?** Discuss
  options: trade-offs in simplicity, testability, extensibility, backward
  compatibility.
